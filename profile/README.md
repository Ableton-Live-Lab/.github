## 🧠 Overview

**Ableton Live** is a Windows-based digital audio workstation designed for music creation, arrangement, and real-time performance. It provides a flexible environment where ideas can be developed quickly, refined with precision, and performed live using a unified workflow.

The software is built around two complementary views that support different creative approaches. One focuses on linear arrangement, ideal for structuring full tracks, while the other emphasizes experimentation and improvisation, making it easy to test ideas and build compositions organically.

Ableton Live is widely used by musicians, producers, and performers who value responsiveness and creative freedom. Its clear interface and adaptable workflow make it suitable for studio production as well as live setups on Windows systems.
